# Network Intrusion Detection System using Transformer


Network intrusion detection systems are crucial for safeguarding computer networks against malicious activities. They analyze network traffic patterns to identify
suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks. These systems play a vital role in maintaining the integrity
and security of our digital infrastructure.

Intrusion detection is a complex task, as attackers constantly evolve their techniques, making it difficult to detect their malicious actions. Traditional methods
often rely on signatures, which can be easily bypassed by new attack methods. 

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [KDD_CUP_99 Dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html), a widely recognized benchmark dataset for intrusion detection research. KDD99 provides a rich collection of network connection records, labeled as either normal or various types of attacks, such as Denial-of-service (DoS), Probe, and User-to-root (U2R). This dataset allows for robust evaluation of intrusion detection models.


## Transformer Model for Intrusion Detection

To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, we utilize a powerful deep learning model known as the Transformer. Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making them well-suited for analyzing network traffic.
These mechanisms enable the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the network traffic data, focusing on patterns and anomalies that are indicative of attacks. By processing network traffic data sequentially, the Transformer learns to identify subtle attack patterns and behaviors that might be missed by traditional methods.

The multi-head self attention mechanisms enables the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the network traffic data, focusing on patterns and anomalies that are indicative of attacks. By processing network traffic data sequentially, the Transformer learns to identify subtle attack patterns and behaviors that might be missed by traditional methods.
